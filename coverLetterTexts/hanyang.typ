I am currently completing my Ph.D. in Physics at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata under the supervision of *Prof. Siddhartha Lal*. My doctoral research focuses on *strongly correlated quantum matter*, in particular understanding Mott metal–insulator transitions and the emergence of non-Fermi liquid phases through the lens of *Kondo breakdown*. I anticipate that I will be able to join for a postdoctoral position by *February 2026*.

My doctoral research work spans a number of themes, with a primary focus on capturing various features (non-Fermi liquids and pseudogapping) of Mott transitions through *Kondo breakdown*. I have also worked on entanglement renormalization in free fermion systems and collaborated with *experimentalists* on lattice spin–phonon interactions in CrSiTe₃. These projects, described in detail in my research statement, reflect my (i) theoretical breadth, (ii) willingness to work on a variety of problems, and (iii) collaborative approach.

I am working on several other projects which I plan to complete before joining for a postdoc. These include (i) studying quantum criticality in a model of *heavy-fermions*, from the perspective of Kondo breakdown, and (ii) looking for punctured-Chern invariant in *integer quantum hall* transitions.

Among the faculty members, I have been closely following the work of *Prof. Moon Jip Park* and *Prof. Pilkyung Moon* on topological phases and bilayer graphene. This is owing to my own experience with topological phase transitions and bilayer heavy-fermion models, and I believe this overlap in our research directions can lead to meaningful collaboration. Going by the kind of research I have carried out during my PhD, I envision several interesting lines of research: 

- *Studying effect of electronic correlations in MATBG through a bilayer impurity model*. One of the ongoing directions of research in the field of magic-angle TBG is via the topological heavy-fermions approach put forward by Prof. Bernevig (among others). Given my experience with correlated quantum impurity models, it may be fruitful to look at an impurity model analogue of such a THF model by allowing a Kondo impurity to hybridise with a topologically non-trivial conduction bath. This can allow us to study various interesting phases within a simplified paradigm.

- *Fate of topological phases in the presence of interactions*. The Hatsugai-Kohmoto model is an exactly-solvable model of correlated electrons, and contains non-Fermi liquid and Mott insulating phases. It might be interesting to introduce such interactions within a model of topological insulator (such as the SSH model), and verify whether the topological features survive. The possiblity of obtaining analytical insights makes this project potentially very fruitful.

More such projects are detailed in my research statement.

I believe that my ability to quickly learn and adapt new analytical and numerical methods make me particularly suitable for this position. Looking ahead, I aim to build on this by investigating *universal aspects* of quantum criticality, particularly developing a unifying framework for fermionic criticality. I am particularly interested in exploring the role of topology and entanglement in such phase transitions. I believe that my ability to quickly *learn and adapt new methods*, both analytical and numerical, make me particularly suitable for this position.

Enclosed are my curriculum vitae, research statement, and supporting materials. I would be glad to provide further information upon request. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your research community.
