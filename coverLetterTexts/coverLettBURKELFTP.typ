I am a quantum condensed matter theorist currently completing my Ph.D. in Physics at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata under the supervision of *Prof. Siddhartha Lal*. My doctoral research focuses on *strongly correlated quantum matter*, in particular understanding Mott metalâ€“insulator transitions and the emergence of non-Fermi liquid phases through the lens of *Kondo breakdown*. I anticipate that I will be able to join for a postdoc position by *February 2026*.

My doctoral research work spans a number of themes, more details of which can be found in my research statement, and employs a variery of analytical and numerical techniques. One primary theme is *Mott transition* through the lens of *Kondo breakdown*, towards which I (along with my collaborators) developed quantum impurity models that successfully capture key aspects of Mott criticality, such as *non-Fermi liquid excitations* and pseudogap physics [#papers.mukherjee2025, #papers.Mukherjee2023, #papers.Patra_2023]. I have also worked on non-interacting models and demonstrated how *entanglement renormalisation* leads to the emergence of an additional dimension, in line with the holographic principle [#papers.Mukherjee2024]. I have also collaborated with the *experimental group* of Prof. N. Kamaraju to complement their observation of a magnetic dimensional crossover in a ferromagnet with a simple phenomenlogical theory that explains key aspects of their experiment.

I am working on a number of other projects which I plan to finish before joining for a postdoc:

- Quantum criticality in a model of heavy-fermions

- Punctured-Chern invariant in integer quantum hall transitions

Much of my work has overlap with the research carried out at the Walter Burke Institute for Theoretical Physics, particularly by *Prof. Olexei I. Motrunich*. For example, 

Enclosed are my curriculum vitae, research statement, and supporting materials. I would be glad to provide further information upon request. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your research community.
