I am currently completing my Ph.D. in Physics at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata under the supervision of *Prof. Siddhartha Lal*. My doctoral research focuses on *strongly correlated quantum matter*, in particular understanding Mott metal–insulator transitions and the emergence of non-Fermi liquid phases through the lens of *Kondo breakdown*. I anticipate that I will be able to join for a postdoctoral position by *February 2026*.

My doctoral research work spans a number of themes, more details of which can be found in my research statement. The main thrust of my work has been towards capturing various features (non-Fermi liquids and pseudogapping) of Mott transitions through *Kondo breakdown*. I have also worked on entanglement renormalization in free fermion systems and collaborated with *experimentalists* on lattice spin–phonon interactions in CrSiTe₃. These projects, described in detail in my research statement, reflect my (i) theoretical breadth, (ii) willingness to work on a variety of problems, and (iii) collaborative approach.

I am working on several other projects which I plan to complete before joining for a postdoc. These include (i) studying quantum criticality in a model of *heavy-fermions*, from the perspective of Kondo breakdown, and (ii) looking for punctured-Chern invariant in *integer quantum hall* transitions.


Looking ahead, I aim to build on this by investigating *universal aspects* of quantum criticality, particularly developing a unifying framework for fermionic criticality. I am particularly interested in exploring the role of topology and entanglement in such phase transitions. I believe that my ability to quickly *learn and adapt new methods*, both analytical and numerical, make me particularly suitable for this position.

Enclosed are my curriculum vitae, research statement, and supporting materials. I would be glad to provide further information upon request. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your research community.
